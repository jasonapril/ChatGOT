# Outputs (`outputs/`)

## Purpose

This directory serves as the primary location for all generated artifacts from running experiments and scripts within the Craft project. It is designed to keep generated files separate from the source code and configuration.

## Current Structure (Workaround)

**Note:** Due to issues integrating Hydra's automatic output management with the current manual Compose API setup in `src/craft/cli/train_commands.py`, we are using a manually managed output structure for the time being.

-   `outputs/`
    -   `runs/<YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS>/`: Contains run-specific outputs managed manually by the `train_commands.py` script. This includes:
        -   `train_runner.log`: The main log file for the run.
        -   `checkpoints/`: Subdirectory containing model checkpoints (`.pt` files) saved during the run.
    -   `tensorboard/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/`: Contains TensorBoard event logs generated by the `TensorBoardLogger` callback. Logs from separate runs are currently stored in separate timestamped directories.
    -   `README.md`: This file.
    -   `hydra/`: (**Currently Unused/Legacy**) This directory *would* be used by default Hydra runs, but is not populated by the current manual setup in `train_commands.py`.

## Guidelines

-   **Manual Management:** Run outputs are currently placed in `outputs/runs/` by the script.
-   **TensorBoard Logging:** TensorBoard logs are saved separately into `outputs/tensorboard/`.
-   **Reproducibility:** Run-specific artifacts (logs, checkpoints) are stored together within the corresponding `outputs/runs/<timestamp>/` directory.
-   **`.gitignore`:** This entire `outputs/` directory should typically be included in `.gitignore`.
-   **Artifact Access:** Find specific run artifacts in `outputs/runs/`. Find TensorBoard logs in `outputs/tensorboard/`.
