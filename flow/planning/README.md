# Flow Planning Documents

This directory contains future-oriented documents that outline improvements, roadmaps, and plans for the Flow system and related projects.

## Contents

- [improvements.md](improvements.md) - Suggested enhancements to the Flow system
- [priorities.md](priorities.md) - Strategic priorities and focus areas
- [refactoring_plan.md](refactoring_plan.md) - Comprehensive plan for code refactoring

## Purpose

The planning directory serves as the forward-looking component of the Flow system. Documents here:

- Capture ideas and suggestions for future work
- Outline long-term visions and roadmaps
- Define project plans that will eventually become active tasks

This directory bridges the gap between current work in the active directory and the foundational principles in the system directory.
