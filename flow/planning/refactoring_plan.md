# Refactoring Plan

*Part of the Flow System. See also: [Tasks](../active/tasks.md), [Priorities](priorities.md).*

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the Craft project. The refactoring aims to improve code organization, reduce technical debt, and create a more maintainable architecture.

## Current Status

We've made significant progress on several aspects of the refactoring:

- âœ… Implemented basic folder structure
- âœ… Consolidated CLI implementation using Typer
- âœ… Added missing utility modules
- âœ… Created basic unit tests

However, there are still important refactoring tasks that need to be completed before we can focus on new features or optimizations.

## Priority Refactoring Tasks

### 1. Complete Model Architecture Refactoring ðŸ”´

The model architecture still contains legacy code patterns and needs to be updated to match the new project structure.

**Tasks:**
- Create a proper abstraction hierarchy for model types
- Implement clean interfaces between model components
- Separate model definition from training logic
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across model files

**Success Criteria:**
- All model code follows the same architectural patterns
- Models can be swapped without changing training code
- Code duplication in model definitions is eliminated

### 2. Standardize Data Pipeline ðŸŸ 

The data processing pipeline has inconsistencies and redundancies that need to be resolved.

**Tasks:**
- Create a unified data loading interface
- Standardize preprocessing steps
- Implement dataset versioning
- Add data validation hooks

**Success Criteria:**
- Data loading is consistent across all model types
- Preprocessing steps are clearly documented and reusable
- Datasets can be versioned and reproduced reliably

### 3. Update Configuration System ðŸŸ 

The configuration system needs to be updated to support the new project structure.

**Tasks:**
- Replace hardcoded values with configuration options
- Implement validation for configuration values
- Create a configuration management system
- Add support for environment-specific configurations

**Success Criteria:**
- All configurable values are defined in configuration files
- Configuration is validated at runtime
- Different environments (dev, test, prod) can be easily configured

### 4. Refactor Training Loop ðŸŸ¡

The training loop contains duplicated code and lacks proper abstractions.

**Tasks:**
- Extract common training functionality into a base trainer
- Implement hooks for custom training behavior
- Add support for different optimization strategies
- Create proper abstractions for evaluation metrics

**Success Criteria:**
- Training code is modular and reusable
- Custom training behavior can be implemented without modifying core code
- Evaluation metrics are consistently tracked and reported

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Model Architecture Refactoring (1 week)

1. **Day 1-2:** Analyze current model implementations and identify common patterns
2. **Day 3-4:** Design and implement base model interfaces and abstract classes
3. **Day 5-7:** Refactor existing models to use the new architecture

### Phase 2: Data Pipeline Standardization (5 days)

1. **Day 1-2:** Create unified data loading interface
2. **Day 3-4:** Implement standardized preprocessing steps
3. **Day 5:** Add dataset versioning and validation

### Phase 3: Configuration System Update (3 days)

1. **Day 1:** Replace hardcoded values with configuration options
2. **Day 2:** Implement configuration validation
3. **Day 3:** Add support for environment-specific configurations

### Phase 4: Training Loop Refactoring (4 days)

1. **Day 1-2:** Extract common training functionality
2. **Day 3:** Implement hooks for custom behavior
3. **Day 4:** Add support for different optimization strategies

## Risk Assessment

**Potential Risks:**
- Refactoring may temporarily break existing functionality
- Integration testing may reveal unforeseen dependencies
- Documentation may become outdated during rapid changes

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests before major changes
- Regular integration testing throughout the refactoring process
- Update documentation immediately after code changes
- Create a rollback plan for each major change

## Success Metrics

The refactoring will be considered successful if:

1. All tests pass after each phase
2. Code duplication is reduced by at least 30%
3. All configuration options are properly documented
4. New model types can be added with minimal code changes
5. Training customization requires no modification to core code

## Dependencies

- Complete unit test suite to validate changes
- Documentation updates to reflect new architecture
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Next Steps

After completing this refactoring, we will be well-positioned to:
1. Implement performance optimizations
2. Add new model architectures
3. Expand dataset support
4. Improve the overall user experience
