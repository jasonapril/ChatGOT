- **Status**: Not started
- **Links**: [Guidelines](../system/guidelines.md)

## User-Added Tasks to Review

### Define Flow Roles
- Each Flow project should specify the type of role(s) needed from Flow. For example, the Craft project requires Flow to act as a software developer, so this should be specifed, and we should be linked to that general domain knowledge by the project. Any exisiting domain knowledge and role specifications should be moved out of flow.md or any other system-level files and into their appropriate files.

### Review Current Practices & Flow Alignment (Context: Recent Debugging) âœ…
- **Sub-tasks**:
  - [x] Review recent debugging work (test fixing) against Flow principles (`flow/flow.md`). âœ…
  - [x] Review recent debugging work against Flow protocol (`flow/flow.md`), especially `tasks.md` update adherence. âœ…
  - [x] Review `flow/meta/` contents for relevance, cruft, and potential refinements. âœ…
  - [x] Review `system/guidelines_and_conventions.md` for any necessary updates discovered during the review. âœ…
  - [x] Brainstorm and document specific improvements for the Flow system (e.g., assisted logging, definition of "significant step", goal linking, periodic checks). âœ…
  - [x] Check `flow/domains/` for potential additions based on recent work (e.g., `pytest_debugging.md`?). âœ…

### Technical Solutions for Consistency

    Linters/Validators: Consider simple scripts to check for valid internal links or consistent use of status markers. (From improvements.md)
    Git hooks: Consider simple scripts/hooks to enforce style or check links. (From improvements.md)
    Templates: Use and maintain standardized templates (like those above) for recurring elements.

### Automation Considerations

To streamline Flow system usage:

    Lightweight Scripting: Consider simple scripts or Git hooks to automate parts of the task update/archival process (e.g., a script to move âœ… tasks from project/tasks.md to project/logs/). (Task rotation script from improvements.md)
    Integration: Consider automatic task updates based on commit messages or PR status. (From improvements.md)
    Automated Reminders: Set up reminders for periodic reviews or consistency checks.
    Minimize Manual Work: The goal of automation should be to reduce repetitive manual effort in maintaining the Flow system, allowing more focus on the actual project tasks.

### Visualization Enhancements
- Create compact dashboard view for task overview. (From improvements.md)
- Implement progress tracking for multi-step tasks. (From improvements.md)
- Create timeline visualization for tasks/dependencies. (From improvements.md)

### Integration Improvements
- Link Flow tasks more directly to specific code files/modules. (From improvements.md)
- Implement GitHub issue integration. (From improvements.md)

### Knowledge Management Improvements
- Implement a `decisions` log/section for architectural choices. (From improvements.md)
- Create a `lessons learned` repository/section. (From improvements.md, relates to Learn from Mistakes task)
- Explore themed collections of related tasks for context. (From improvements.md)

### Process Refinements
- Add explicit "review checkpoints" for long-running tasks. (From improvements.md)
- Implement a simple task estimation system. (From improvements.md)
- Create a retrospective template/process for Flow effectiveness. (From improvements.md)

### Expansion to Team Use (Lower Priority)
- Define lightweight role assignments for tasks. (From improvements.md)
- Develop conflict resolution guidelines for collaborative editing. (From improvements.md)
- Create onboarding documentation specifically for Flow. (From improvements.md)

### Simplify Flow Goals
- Flow gives AI agents memory and executive functioning.

### Generalize Project Details Mentioned Outside the Project
- Standardize top-level files and folders
- Consider templates for different types of projects (see domains)
- Consider configuration profiles for different project types/domains. (From config_implementation.md)

### Add Scripts to Keep Flow's Data Standardized, Organized, Updated, and Integrous
- Functional Alignment: Ensure that all tasks/plans/projects/roadmaps are aligned with stated goals/principles.
- Ensure that task dependencies are updated.
- Ensure that architectural decisions are upheld.
- Move items to backlog or associated projects/plans/roadmaps to clear space in memory.

### Review Terminology
- Should tasks have subtasks?
- What's the difference between plans, projects, roadmaps, goals, etc.?

### Standardize Tasks to Always Begin with Verbs?

### Identify and Decide How to Handle Errors, Debugging, and Troubleshooting

### Understand How to Remember

- We need to define exactly how you "remember": by storing information in files like this one. But we should be careful that the information is effectively organized.

### Learn from Mistakes
- You (the AI agent) need to recognize when you're in troubleshooting mode as a result of your own error, solve the problem, then perform a sort of post mortem to better understand what you could have done to prevent the problem or solve the problem more effectively, then generalize that understanding (as much as possible) to your instructions to incorporate the newfound knowledge in the future.
- In short, you should be able to recognize your mistakes and learn from them by "remembering."

### Rename `active` Folder to `current`?
- Maintains a theme. A current flows. Too much?

### Implement Time Management Feature
- This may require scripts more than documentation.
- Closely related to Implement Prospective Memory Features task

### Find Way to Get Time of Day
- This is critical for time management and logs. Timestamps are generally useful properties.

### Consider GUI Editor for Flow (Low Priority)
- Explore potential for a GUI-based editor for managing Flow files. (From config_implementation.md)

### Consider VCS Integration for Flow Changes (Low Priority)
- Explore integrating Flow state/config changes with version control. (From config_implementation.md)

### Brainstormed Improvements (Apr 2025 Review)
- **Goal:** Document specific improvement ideas identified during the Flow system review.
- **Items:**
  - **Assisted Logging:** AI proposes concise, datestamped log entries for `tasks.md` after significant actions to capture volatile context.
  - **Goal Linking:** Add explicit `Related Goals:` field to task templates linking tasks to high-level goals (defined elsewhere).
  - **Define "Significant Step":** Clarify the threshold/criteria for when an AI agent MUST update `tasks.md` (e.g., after each file edit? After a command runs? After a sub-task is complete?). Add to `guidelines_and_conventions.md`.
  - **Periodic Flow Checks/Audits:** Formalize triggers or schedule for reviewing Flow system health, consistency, and alignment (perhaps as a recurring meta-task).
  - **Refine Core Analogy:** Update `model.md` and potentially `flow.md` to reflect the broader "Memory & Executive Function Aid" concept.
  - **Define Context Loading Strategy:** Address how/when Flow files are loaded into AI context. 
    - *Problem:* Relying on manual attachment or agent protocol adherence is fragile/inefficient.
    - *Short-Term Proposal:* Define "Core Context" files (`flow.md`, relevant `tasks.md`), strengthen agent protocol for proactive reads, improve internal linking, use assisted logging.
    - *Long-Term Goal:* Explore dynamic/triggered context loading (likely requires external tool support).
  - **Review Terminology:** Ensure clarity and consistent use of terms defined in `glossary.md` (overlaps with existing task).
