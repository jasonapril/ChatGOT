# Meta Tasks

This document tracks tasks related to the development and improvement of the Flow system itself.

## Active Tasks

### Implement Priority Continuity Mechanisms ðŸ”´
- **Description**: Create a system to maintain priority continuity across planning cycles, ensuring important tasks don't get lost during transitions
- **Notes**: Should include documentation on how to carry priorities forward and adjust as needed
- **Status**: Planning
- **Links**: [Evolution](evolution.md)

### Localize Domain Knowledge for Craft Project ðŸŸ 
- **Description**: Document and organize domain-specific knowledge for the Craft project
- **Notes**: Initial structure created in reference/craft_domain.md; needs detailed expansion
- **Status**: Started
- **Links**: [Domain Knowledge Outline](../reference/craft_domain.md)

### Develop Flow Glossary ðŸŸ¡
- **Description**: Create a comprehensive glossary of Flow terminology and concepts
- **Notes**: Will help clarify distinctions between terms like "project," "plan," and "goal"
- **Status**: Not started
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### Implement Prospective Memory Features ðŸŸ¡
- **Description**: Develop mechanisms for remembering to perform planned actions at appropriate times
- **Notes**: Could include scheduled reviews, reminders, and temporal markers
- **Status**: Conceptual
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

## Upcoming Tasks

### Create Short-term Buffer Mechanism
- **Description**: Implement a system for temporarily storing ideas and thoughts before proper organization
- **Notes**: Should be lightweight and require minimal effort to use
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### Enhance Focus Mechanisms
- **Description**: Develop better tools for directing attention to high-priority tasks
- **Notes**: Consider implementing a "current focus" section in active tasks
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### Develop Meta Project Structure
- **Description**: Clarify how meta documentation relates to the rest of Flow
- **Notes**: Need to determine if meta should be treated as a project, plan, or something else
- **Links**: [Evolution](evolution.md)

### Implement Sidetrack Detection
- **Description**: Create a mechanism for Flow to detect when work is getting too far from priority tasks
- **Notes**: Could compare current work against prioritized tasks to identify divergence
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

## User-Added Tasks to Review

### Standardize Tasks to Always Begin with Verbs?

### Identify and Decide How to Handle Errors, Debugging, and Troubleshooting

### Understand How to Remember

- We need to define exactly how you "remember": by storing information in files like this one. But we should be careful that the information is effectively organized.

### Learn from Mistakes
- You need to recognize when you're in troubleshooting mode as a result of your own error, solve the problem, then perform a sort of post mortem to better understand what you could have done to prevent the problem or solve the problem more effectively, then generalize that understanding (as much as possible) to your instructions to incorporate the newfound knowledge in the future.
- In short, you should be able to recognize your mistakes and learn from them by "remembering."

### Rename `active` Folder to `current`?
- Maintains a theme. A current flows. Too much?

### Implement Time Management Feature
- This may require scripts more than documentation.
- Closely related to Implement Prospective Memory Features task

### Find Way to Get Time of Day
- This is critical for time management and logs. Timestamps are generally useful properties.

## Completed Tasks

### Create Meta Directory Structure
- **Description**: Establish a dedicated directory for Flow's self-documentation
- **Completion Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Outcome**: Created meta directory with initial files for model, evolution, and tasks

### Document Memory Model
- **Description**: Create comprehensive documentation of Flow's memory model
- **Completion Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Outcome**: Created model.md documenting memory systems and cognitive enhancement strategies

### Document Flow Evolution
- **Description**: Create documentation tracking Flow's development history and trajectory
- **Completion Date**: 2025-03-26
- **Outcome**: Created evolution.md capturing phases of development and future directions
