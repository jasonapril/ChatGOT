# Meta Tasks

This document tracks tasks related to the development and improvement of the Flow system itself.

## Active Tasks

### ðŸ”´ Implement Priority Continuity Mechanisms
- **Description**: Create a system to maintain priority continuity across planning cycles, ensuring important tasks don't get lost during transitions
- **Notes**: Should include documentation on how to carry priorities forward and adjust as needed
- **Status**: Planning
- **Links**: [Evolution](evolution.md)

### ðŸŸ¡ Develop Flow Glossary
- **Description**: Create a comprehensive glossary of Flow terminology and concepts
- **Notes**: Will help clarify distinctions between terms like "project," "plan," and "goal"
- **Status**: Not started
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### ðŸŸ¡ Implement Prospective Memory Features
- **Description**: Develop mechanisms for remembering to perform planned actions at appropriate times
- **Notes**: Could include scheduled reviews, reminders, and temporal markers
- **Status**: Conceptual
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

## Upcoming Tasks

### Create Short-term Buffer Mechanism
- **Description**: Implement a system for temporarily storing ideas and thoughts before proper organization
- **Notes**: Should be lightweight and require minimal effort to use
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### Enhance Focus Mechanisms
- **Description**: Develop better tools for directing attention to high-priority tasks
- **Notes**: Consider implementing a "current focus" section in active tasks
- **Links**: [Model](model.md)

### Develop Meta Project Structure
- **Description**: Clarify how meta documentation relates to the rest of Flow
- **Notes**: Need to determine if meta should be treated as a project, plan, or something else
- **Links**: [Evolution](evolution.md)
