# Flow Meta Documentation

This directory contains self-referential documentation about Flow itself - its design principles, evolution, and conceptual models. Unlike other Flow directories that focus on external projects, the meta directory is where Flow documents and plans its own development.

## Contents

This directory contains the following files and subdirectories related to Flow's design, operation, and evolution:

- `README.md`: This file - provides an overview of the meta directory.
- `model.md`: The conceptual model behind Flow (e.g., memory analogies).
- `principles.md`: Core design philosophy and guiding principles.
- `evolution.md`: Tracks the development history and future directions of Flow.
- `tasks.md`: Tasks specifically for improving the Flow system itself.
- `glossary.md`: Definitions of key terms used within the Flow system.
- `improvements.md`: Suggestions for enhancing the Flow system (potentially related to `tasks.md`).
- `documentation_guidelines.md`: Specific guidelines related to writing and maintaining documentation (likely related to `system/consistency.md`).
- `troubleshooting_and_debugging.md`: Consolidated guide covering general troubleshooting frameworks, code debugging strategies, and the post-mortem process.
- `troubleshooting_guides/`: (Directory) Contains more specific guides for troubleshooting particular problems (often generated via post-mortems).

## Purpose

The meta directory serves a special purpose in the Flow system by providing:

1. **Self-reflection** - Documentation of Flow's own design decisions and rationale
2. **Continuity** - Tracking of how Flow evolves over time
3. **Conceptual Foundation** - Explicit models that inform Flow's structure
4. **Improvement Planning** - Tasks and priorities for enhancing Flow itself

Think of meta as "Flow thinking about Flow" - a layer of metacognition that helps Flow improve itself over time.
