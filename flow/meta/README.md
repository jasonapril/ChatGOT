# Flow Meta Documentation

This directory contains self-referential documentation about Flow itself - its design principles, evolution, and conceptual models. Unlike other Flow directories that focus on external projects, the meta directory is where Flow documents and plans its own development.

## Contents

- [model.md](model.md) - The conceptual model behind Flow, including memory and attention analogies
- [evolution.md](evolution.md) - How Flow itself changes and grows over time
- [principles.md](principles.md) - Core design philosophy and guiding principles behind Flow
- [tasks.md](tasks.md) - Tasks related to Flow's own development and improvement

## Purpose

The meta directory serves a special purpose in the Flow system by providing:

1. **Self-reflection** - Documentation of Flow's own design decisions and rationale
2. **Continuity** - Tracking of how Flow evolves over time
3. **Conceptual Foundation** - Explicit models that inform Flow's structure
4. **Improvement Planning** - Tasks and priorities for enhancing Flow itself

Think of meta as "Flow thinking about Flow" - a layer of metacognition that helps Flow improve itself over time.
