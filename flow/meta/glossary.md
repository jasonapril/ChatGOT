# Flow Glossary

This document provides definitions for terminology used within the Flow system to ensure consistency and clarity.

## Core Concepts

### Task
A discrete unit of work with a specific outcome. Tasks are the primary elements tracked in the Flow system.

### Project
A collection of related tasks that together achieve a larger goal. Projects have defined boundaries and success criteria.

### Goal
A desired outcome that may span multiple projects. Goals are higher-level than projects and often more aspirational.

### Plan
A structured approach to achieving a goal or completing a project. Plans include specific tasks arranged in a logical sequence.

### Priority
The relative importance of a task, project, or goal.

### Status
The current state of a task, indicating whether it is not started, in progress, blocked, or completed.

## Memory System

### Working Memory
The active information currently being used or manipulated, primarily represented by the `active/` directory.

### Long-term Memory
Information stored for future reference, including system documentation, reference materials, and historical records.

### Prospective Memory
The system for remembering to perform actions at appropriate future times.

### Short-term Buffer
A temporary storage area for capturing thoughts, ideas, or information before proper categorization.

## Directory Structure

### Project Directory (`flow/project/`)
Contains currently relevant tasks (`tasks.md`) and logs (`logs/`) for the specific project being worked on.

### Guidelines & Conventions (`flow/guidelines_and_conventions.md`)
Provides detailed operational rules, formats, templates, and procedures.

### Meta Directory (`flow/meta/`)
Contains Flow's self-documentation (model, principles, evolution, etc.) and improvement tasks (`tasks.md`).

### Domains Directory (`flow/domains/`)
Stores domain-specific knowledge bases relevant to the project (e.g., `python/`, `software_development/`).

### Logs Directory (`flow/project/logs/`)
Archives historical records of completed tasks and past decisions for a specific project.

## Document Types

### Task Document
A file containing a list of tasks, typically organized by priority and status.

### Guideline Document
A file defining rules and best practices for using the Flow system.

### Reference Document
A file containing technical details and implementation information.

### Planning Document
A file outlining future directions, improvements, or strategies.

## Process Terminology

### Task Management
The process of creating, tracking, prioritizing, and completing tasks.

### Task Lifecycle
The progression of a task from creation through completion and archival.

### Priority Continuity
The maintenance of consistent priorities across planning cycles.

### Context Switching
The process of changing focus from one task or project to another.

### Archival
The process of moving completed tasks and outdated information to the logs directory.
