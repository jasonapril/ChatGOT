# Flow Memory Model

The Flow System is designed as an externalized memory system to enhance productivity and reduce cognitive load. This document describes the conceptual memory model that underlies Flow's design and functionality.

## Memory Systems

### Working Memory
- **Active Tasks**: Current tasks in focus, managed in `active/tasks.md`
- **Priorities**: Strategic focus areas that guide attention, documented in `planning/priorities.md`
- **Context Retention**: Flow preserves context through consistent structure and cross-referencing

### Long-term Memory
- **System Documentation**: Core principles and guidelines stored in the `system/` directory
- **Reference Material**: Technical details and implementations in the `reference/` directory
- **Historical Records**: Completed tasks and past decisions archived in `logs/`

### Prospective Memory
- **Planned Enhancements**: Future improvements captured in `planning/improvements.md`
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Upcoming work items with timing considerations
- **Reminders**: System for bringing relevant information to attention at the right time

### Short-term Buffers
- **Task Notes**: Temporary workspace for capturing thoughts during task execution
- **Quick Captures**: Mechanism for rapidly storing information for later processing
- **Staging Areas**: Temporary storage for information that needs organization

## Memory Operations

### Encoding
- **Standardized Formats**: Consistent document structures for efficient information storage
- **Cross-referencing**: Linking related information across documents
- **Categorization**: Organizing information by type, priority, and relevance

### Retrieval
- **Directory Structure**: Intuitive organization for finding information
- **Search Mechanisms**: Tools for locating specific information quickly
- **Context Cues**: Using consistent markers and references to aid recall

### Forgetting
- **Archival Process**: Moving completed items to logs for historical reference
- **Pruning**: Removing obsolete or redundant information
- **Summarization**: Condensing detailed information for efficient storage

## Cognitive Enhancement Strategies

### Attention Management
- **Focus Mechanisms**: Tools for directing attention to priority tasks
- **Distraction Reduction**: Minimizing irrelevant information in active documents
- **Context Switching**: Protocols for efficiently changing between tasks

### Metacognition
- **Self-monitoring**: Regular reviews of system effectiveness
- **Adaptation**: Evolving the system based on observed patterns and needs
- **Reflection**: Documenting lessons learned and system improvements

## Known Limitations

- **Information Overload**: Risk of creating too many documents or excessive detail
- **Maintenance Burden**: Effort required to keep the system updated and organized
- **Learning Curve**: Time needed to understand and effectively use all system components

## Future Directions

- Implementing automation for routine memory operations
- Developing more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms
- Creating adaptive structures that evolve based on usage patterns
