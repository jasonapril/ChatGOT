# Consistency Plan for Documentation

*Part of the Flow System. See also: [Guidelines](guidelines.md), [Tasks](../active/tasks.md).*

## Overview

This document outlines strategies to prevent inconsistencies in the Flow documentation system, specifically addressing issues related to duplicate information, inconsistent formatting, and lack of clear authoritative sources.

## Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information should be defined in exactly one place.
2. **Cross-References**: Instead of duplicating information, use links to reference canonical definitions.
3. **Standardized Formats**: Use consistent formatting and naming conventions across all documentation.
4. **Explicit Ownership**: Clearly designate which files are authoritative for which types of information.

## Prevention Strategies

### Documentation Structure

- **Hierarchy of Authority**:
  - [Guidelines](guidelines.md): Contains all canonical definitions, templates, and guidelines
  - [Tasks](../active/tasks.md): Working memory that refers to Guidelines for standards
  - Specific task documents: Implementation details that follow Guidelines conventions

- **File Responsibilities**:
  - Define responsibilities clearly for each file in the documentation system
  - Document these responsibilities at the top of each file
  - Avoid overlap in primary responsibilities between files

### Maintenance Practices

- **Regular Audits**:
  - Schedule bi-weekly audits of documentation consistency
  - Verify that cross-references remain valid
  - Check for any duplicated information that should be consolidated

- **Change Management**:
  - When updating standards or guidelines, start with the authoritative source file
  - Create a checklist of other files that might be affected
  - Document changes in the log section of affected files

- **Refactoring Sessions**:
  - Periodically review the entire documentation system
  - Look for opportunities to consolidate or simplify
  - Remove outdated information and archived content that's no longer relevant

### Technical Solutions

- **Automated Validation**:
  - Create simple scripts to verify cross-references remain valid
  - Check for consistency in formatting and priority indicators
  - Automated reminders for regular documentation maintenance tasks

- **Templates**:
  - Use standardized templates for different documentation elements
  - Ensure templates reference authoritative sources rather than duplicating information
  - Update templates when standards change

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Immediate**: Update all existing documents to follow these guidelines
2. **Short-term** (1-2 weeks): Develop basic validation scripts 
3. **Medium-term** (2-4 weeks): Complete a full audit and refactoring of the documentation system
4. **Long-term**: Establish regular maintenance schedule and verification processes

## Success Criteria

The consistency plan will be considered successful if:

1. Information is defined in exactly one authoritative source
2. Cross-references are consistently used instead of duplication
3. Regular audits find fewer than 3 inconsistencies per cycle
4. Documentation maintenance time decreases by at least 30%
5. New team members can easily find authoritative information
