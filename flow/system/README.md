# Flow System Directory

This directory contains the core definitions, guidelines, and principles that govern the Flow system's operation and usage across different projects.

## Purpose

The files here define the "how" of the Flow system:

*   How tasks are tracked and managed.
*   How documentation should be structured and maintained.
*   How AI agents should interact with the system.
*   The standard conventions and capabilities.

## Key Files

*   **`guidelines.md`**: The primary authoritative document. Contains core principles, usage instructions, task management details, AI interaction protocols, system conventions, and consistency guidelines. **Consult this first.**
*   **`agent_capabilities.md`**: Describes the known capabilities and limitations of the assisting AI agent within the Flow system.
*   **`README.md`**: This overview file.

Consult these files for understanding how to use and maintain the Flow system effectively.

## Contents

- [guidelines.md](guidelines.md) - Core principles and standards for the Flow system
- [consistency.md](consistency.md) - Strategies to prevent documentation inconsistencies
- [configuration.md](configuration.md) - System preferences and configuration options

## Purpose

The system directory serves as the foundation of the Flow system. Documents here:

- Define the canonical standards and practices
- Change infrequently and only with careful consideration
- Are referenced by other documents rather than duplicating their content

When questions arise about how the Flow system should work, the documents in this directory provide the authoritative answers.
