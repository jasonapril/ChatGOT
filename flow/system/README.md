# Flow System Core

This directory contains the foundational documents that define how the Flow system operates. These are the authoritative sources for standards, templates, and rules.

## Contents

- [guidelines.md](guidelines.md) - Core principles and standards for the Flow system
- [consistency.md](consistency.md) - Strategies to prevent documentation inconsistencies
- [configuration.md](configuration.md) - System preferences and configuration options

## Purpose

The system directory serves as the foundation of the Flow system. Documents here:

- Define the canonical standards and practices
- Change infrequently and only with careful consideration
- Are referenced by other documents rather than duplicating their content

When questions arise about how the Flow system should work, the documents in this directory provide the authoritative answers.
