# Flow System

The Flow System is a lightweight documentation-based project management approach designed to handle complex projects with minimal overhead.

## Directory Structure

- **[active/](active/)** - Current working memory containing active tasks and priorities
  - [tasks.md](active/tasks.md) - Central hub for all active tasks

- **[system/](system/)** - Foundational documents that define the Flow system
  - [guidelines.md](system/guidelines.md) - Core principles and standards
  - [consistency.md](system/consistency.md) - Preventing documentation inconsistencies
  - [configuration.md](system/configuration.md) - System preferences

- **[planning/](planning/)** - Future-oriented documents and improvements
  - [improvements.md](planning/improvements.md) - Enhancement suggestions
  - [priorities.md](planning/priorities.md) - Strategic priorities and focus areas
  - [refactoring_plan.md](planning/refactoring_plan.md) - Comprehensive refactoring plan

- **[reference/](reference/)** - Implementation details and technical information
  - [config_implementation.md](reference/config_implementation.md) - Configuration implementation

- **[meta/](meta/)** - Flow's self-documentation and improvement plans
  - [model.md](meta/model.md) - Conceptual model behind Flow
  - [evolution.md](meta/evolution.md) - How Flow itself changes over time
  - [principles.md](meta/principles.md) - Core design philosophy
  - [tasks.md](meta/tasks.md) - Tasks for Flow's own development

- **[logs/](logs/)** - Historical records and archives

## Getting Started

1. Start with [active/tasks.md](active/tasks.md) to see current tasks and priorities
2. Refer to [system/guidelines.md](system/guidelines.md) for system standards
3. Add new tasks directly to tasks.md following the templates in guidelines.md
4. Archive completed tasks to the logs directory

## Core Principles

- **Single Source of Truth**: Each piece of information is defined in one place
- **Cross-References**: Use links instead of duplicating information
- **Working Memory**: The active directory serves as a centralized hub
- **Clear Hierarchy**: System defines standards, Active implements them
