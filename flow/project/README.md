# Project Directory

This directory holds all information specific to the project currently being managed by the Flow system.

## Purpose

The `project/` directory separates the dynamic, project-specific context (tasks, plans, logs, references) from the stable, system-level guidelines (`system/`) and the meta-documentation about Flow itself (`meta/`).

## Structure

### Working Memory

- **`tasks.md`** reflects *what is happening now*.

### Long-term Memory

- **`reference.md`**: Stores project-specific technical documentation, configuration details, or other reference materials needed for the current project.
- **`logs/`**: Archives historical records, such as completed task logs or event timelines.

### Executive Hierarchy

Documents related to future work, such as roadmaps, specific feature plans, or improvement proposals.

- **`vision.md`
