# Flow Project Directory

## Vision / Goals

- Develop AI models for low-spec devices (performance critical)
- Experiment with cutting edge architectures and methods (research)

## Overview

This directory contains files specific to the current project's state, tasks,
and conventions, supplementing the core Flow system.

## Relevant Domains

This project utilizes domain knowledge from the following areas:

- **Software Development**: General principles, guidelines, and troubleshooting for software engineering. See [../domains/software_development/README.md](../domains/software_development/README.md).

# Project Directory

This directory holds all information specific to the project currently being managed by the Flow system.

## Purpose

The `project/` directory separates the dynamic, project-specific context (tasks, plans, logs, references) from the stable, system-level guidelines (`system/`) and the meta-documentation about Flow itself (`meta/`).

## Structure

*   **`tasks.md`**: Tracks active development tasks, priorities, and status.
*   **`conventions.md`**: Documents project-specific conventions (e.g., directory structures, naming).
*   **`logs/`**: Archives historical records, such as completed task logs or event timelines.
*   **`README.md`**: This file.

### Working Memory

- **`tasks.md`** reflects *what is happening now*.

### Long-term Memory

- **`reference.md`**: Stores project-specific technical documentation, configuration details, or other reference materials needed for the current project.
- **`logs/`**: Archives historical records, such as completed task logs or event timelines.

### Executive Hierarchy

Documents related to future work, such as roadmaps, specific feature plans, or improvement proposals.
