TODO: This is meant to be a document listing the rationale for all the external dependencies in Craft.

General principles:

- Dependecies are worth it if they prevent us from having to reinvent the wheel, thus speeding up development.
- If we use common packages, then other developers are likely to be familiar with them.

List of dependencies:

- Hydra
- Pydandtic
- Tensorboard
