# Flow Archive Directory

This directory contains archived logs and historical records from the Flow system.

## Purpose

The logs directory serves as the historical archive for the Flow system. Items stored here:

- Are no longer actively referenced in day-to-day operations
- Provide historical context and record-keeping
- Document past decisions and completed work

Archives are organized by date to make it easier to find historical information when needed.
