# Flow System Priorities

*Part of the Flow System. See also: [Tasks](../active/tasks.md), [Guidelines](../system/guidelines.md), [Refactoring Plan](refactoring_plan.md).*

## Current Focus Areas

This document outlines the strategic priorities for the Flow system and related projects. It helps guide decision-making about which tasks to prioritize and where to allocate resources.

### Short-Term Priorities (Next 2 Weeks)

1. **Complete Refactoring Plan** 🔴
   - Implement model architecture abstractions
   - Standardize data pipeline interfaces
   - Update configuration system
   - Refactor training loop for better extensibility
   
2. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline** 🟠
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Implement continuous deployment for documentation
   - Create status badges for the repository

3. **Documentation Improvements** 🟡
   - Create thorough documentation of model architecture options
   - Update getting started guide with the latest CLI changes
   - Add diagrams illustrating the system architecture

### Medium-Term Priorities (Next 2 Months)

1. **Training Optimization** 🟡
   - Improve performance of the training loop
   - Implement mixed-precision training
   - Add gradient accumulation for larger effective batch sizes
   
2. **User Interface Development** 🟡
   - Create a simple web interface for model interaction
   - Implement visualization tools for model outputs
   - Add user authentication for shared deployments

3. **Dataset Expansion** 🟢
   - Add support for additional data formats
   - Implement preprocessing for specialized text types
   - Create tools for dataset quality assessment

### Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

1. **Model Architecture Experiments** 🟢
   - Evaluate alternative attention mechanisms
   - Test memory-efficient transformer variants
   - Benchmark performance across different configurations

2. **Multi-Modal Capabilities** 🟢
   - Research text-to-image generation possibilities
   - Explore audio transcription integration
   - Investigate multimodal transformer architectures

3. **Distributed Training Support** 🟢
   - Implement multi-GPU training
   - Add support for distributed training across nodes
   - Optimize memory usage for large models

4. **Ecosystem Development** 🟢
   - Build plugin system for extensibility
   - Create package management for model sharing
   - Develop community contribution guidelines

## Priority Assessment Criteria

Priorities are evaluated based on:

1. **Impact**: How significantly will this improve the system?
2. **Effort**: How much work is required to implement it?
3. **Dependencies**: What other components depend on this?
4. **Urgency**: How time-sensitive is this work?
5. **Strategic Alignment**: How well does this support long-term goals?

## Review Schedule

This priorities document is reviewed and updated:

- Bi-weekly for short-term priorities
- Monthly for medium-term priorities
- Quarterly for long-term vision
