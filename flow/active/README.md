# Active Flow Documents

This directory contains the current working memory of the Flow system, with documents that are actively referenced and updated on a regular basis.

## Contents

- [tasks.md](tasks.md) - The central hub for all active tasks, providing at-a-glance visibility into current work, recently completed tasks, and upcoming priorities.

## Purpose

The active directory serves as the operational center of the Flow system. Documents here are designed to be:

- Frequently updated (often daily)
- Directly actionable
- Immediately relevant to current work

When using the Flow system, this directory should be the first place to check for current status and priorities.
