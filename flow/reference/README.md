# Flow Reference Documents

This directory contains technical and implementation details that support the Flow system but are not needed for everyday use.

## Contents

- [config_implementation.md](config_implementation.md) - Technical details of the configuration system

## Purpose

The reference directory serves as the knowledge repository for specialized information. Documents here:

- Provide technical implementation details
- Explain the "how" behind Flow system functionality
- Serve as a resource for advanced users and developers

Unlike the active or system directories, these documents are referenced less frequently but contain important details when they're needed.
