# Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This document outlines our comprehensive plan for refactoring the project structure and documentation. It aims to create a maintainable, organized, and effective system that aligns with our workflow principles.

## Objectives

- Establish a clear and organized project structure.
- Reorganize scattered documentation under a unified hierarchy.
- Improve project tracking and version control.
- Address performance challenges (such as low GPU utilization).

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation
- Inventory existing documentation and code structure.
- Define key milestones, deliverables, and responsibilities.
- Identify critical dependencies and topics for in-depth review.

### Phase 2: Execution
- Implement folder structure cleanup and documentation migration.
- Set up the state tracking system and integrate it with our workflow.
- Establish testing and validation procedures for the refactoring process.

### Phase 3: Refinement and Retrospection
- Conduct a retrospective review to capture lessons learned and define success metrics.
- Archive completed tasks and reconcile the active task queue in our workflow system.
- Update long-term documentation (e.g., roadmap.md, backlog.md) with finalized insights.

## Next Steps

- Finalize detailed task breakdowns for each phase.
- Integrate this plan with our Workflow System (see [Workflow System Guidelines](../workflow/workflow_system.md)) and the [Working Memory](../../working_memory.md) file.
- Schedule a review session to iterate and refine the plan based on ongoing progress.

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

#### Code Organization Analysis
- [ ] Conduct static analysis of project imports and dependencies
- [ ] Identify circular dependencies and code coupling issues
- [ ] Map current module relationships with dependency graphs
- [ ] Determine which components can be extracted into standalone libraries

#### Performance Assessment
- [ ] Profile model training and inference to identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Analyze GPU memory usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- [ ] Benchmark data loading pipeline to identify potential improvements
- [ ] Evaluate framework-specific optimizations (PyTorch, CUDA)

#### Testing Framework Requirements
- [ ] Document coverage gaps in current test suite
- [ ] Define requirements for integration and unit test improvements
- [ ] Establish benchmarking metrics and performance regression tests
- [ ] Design test data management for consistent evaluation

### Phase 2: Execution

#### Code Restructuring
- [ ] Implement proper package structure with clear API boundaries
- [ ] Extract data processing pipelines into dedicated modules
- [ ] Refactor model code to improve composition and inheritance patterns
- [ ] Update import structure across the codebase

#### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement batch size auto-tuning based on available GPU memory
- [ ] Add gradient checkpointing configuration for larger models
- [ ] Optimize data loading with prefetching and caching
- [ ] Implement optional mixed precision training

#### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Create CI pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Develop parameterized tests for model configurations
- [ ] Implement performance regression tests with history tracking
- [ ] Add test data versioning for reproducibility

### Phase 3: Refinement and Retrospection

#### Integration and System Testing
- [ ] Verify end-to-end functionality with complete pipelines
- [ ] Benchmark performance improvements against baseline metrics
- [ ] Document any regressions or issues discovered
- [ ] Address edge cases and potential failure modes

#### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect new structure
- [ ] Create architecture diagrams for major subsystems
- [ ] Document performance tuning guidelines for users
- [ ] Update README with new project structure

#### Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Create example notebooks demonstrating refactored API usage
- [ ] Document lessons learned and architectural decisions
- [ ] Update contribution guidelines to reflect new organization
- [ ] Create onboarding guide for new developers

## Timeline and Milestones

### Milestone 1: Analysis Complete (Target: +2 weeks)
- Complete code organization analysis
- Finish performance assessment
- Define testing framework requirements

### Milestone 2: Core Refactoring (Target: +4 weeks)
- Complete code restructuring tasks
- Implement initial performance optimizations
- Set up basic testing infrastructure

### Milestone 3: Final Integration (Target: +6 weeks)
- Finish all system testing
- Complete documentation updates
- Address all discovered issues

## Success Criteria

The refactoring effort will be considered successful when:

1. All tests pass in the new structure with equivalent or better coverage
2. Performance benchmarks show at least 20% improvement in training throughput
3. GPU utilization reaches at least 80% during training
4. Documentation is complete and accurately reflects the new architecture
5. No regressions in model quality or functionality are introduced
