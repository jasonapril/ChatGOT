# Project State [2025-03-26]

## Active Work
1. **Main Task: Project Refactoring**
   - Description: Comprehensive refactoring of project structure and documentation
   - Current status: Planning phase, creating documentation structure
   - Blockers/Issues: None currently
   - Related tasks:
     - Documentation reorganization
     - Folder structure cleanup
     - State tracking system implementation
   - Reference files:
     - `docs/roadmap.md` - Main refactoring plan
     - `docs/projects/current.md` - Current sprint details
     - `docs/projects/backlog.md` - Future tasks

2. **Side Quests**
   - None currently, but this file will track any that emerge during refactoring

## Recent History
- [2025-03-26] Started planning project refactoring
- [2025-03-26] Created roadmap.md with comprehensive refactoring plan
- [2025-03-26] Identified need for state tracking system
- [2025-03-26] Created this state.md file
- [2025-03-26] Updated state with references to all relevant files

## Current Focus
- Primary goal: Implement organized, maintainable project structure
- Immediate next steps:
  1. Review and finalize refactoring plan
  2. Create new documentation structure
  3. Begin documentation migration
  4. Set up state tracking system
- Known issues to address:
  - Scattered documentation in root directory
  - Inconsistent folder organization
  - Need for better project tracking
  - Low GPU utilization (1GB out of 4GB)

## Related Projects and States
- Performance Optimization
  - Reference: `docs/performance/optimizations.md`
  - Status: On hold, will be addressed after refactoring
  - Key issue: GPU utilization needs improvement

- Training Pipeline
  - Reference: `docs/architecture/training-pipeline.md`
  - Status: Will be reorganized during refactoring
  - Note: Keep track of current training performance metrics

## Notes
- Important decisions:
  - Moving all documentation under docs/
  - Creating artifacts/ directory for generated content
  - Implementing state tracking system
  - Prioritizing documentation reorganization before code changes
- Lessons learned:
  - Need better organization from the start
  - State tracking will help prevent getting lost in side quests
  - Keep performance metrics in mind during refactoring
- Things to remember:
  - Keep documentation up to date during refactoring
  - Maintain backward compatibility where possible
  - Document all major changes
  - Track GPU utilization improvements after refactoring

## Next Session
- Review this state file first
- Continue with documentation reorganization
- Keep track of any new side quests that emerge
- Update state file as work progresses

## Refactoring Suggestions

- Break down high-level objectives into finer-grained subtasks. For Documentation reorganization, include: conducting a documentation inventory, defining a consistent folder/naming strategy, and outlining the migration process with checkpoints.
- Clarify task dependencies and milestones by adding a mini timeline or checklist for each major sub-task (e.g., folder structure cleanup, state tracking system implementation).
- Include version control and backup strategies, such as establishing branch management rules and rollback checkpoints before major changes.
- Isolate performance-related items and plan a separate analysis phase for addressing low GPU utilization.
- Integrate testing and validation steps, particularly for the state tracking system, with integration and smoke tests to catch issues early.
- Link the refactoring effort explicitly with related documents (roadmap.md, current.md, backlog.md) to ensure alignment.
- Clearly define the 'Folder structure cleanup' objective by drafting a tentative new structure diagram or bullet list.

## Retrospective and Memory Management Suggestions

- After refactoring, hold a retrospective review to evaluate what went well, what didn't, and capture key lessons learned along with defining success metrics.
- Maintain the working memory in state.md by scheduling regular review sessions and updates, ensuring the file remains a dynamic reflection of the project's current state.
- Establish a process to consolidate key decisions and outcomes from the state file into long-term documentation (e.g., roadmap.md, current.md, backlog.md) at defined milestones.
- Assign clear roles and responsibilities for maintaining and updating both working memory and long-term project documentation.
- Consider automation or tooling (e.g., scripts or integrations with version control) to help summarize and migrate updates from state.md into permanent documentation.

## Working Memory Update and Maintenance Instructions

- Treat this document (state.md, or working_memory.md if renamed) as a dynamic record that is updated continuously throughout all project activities.
- Update this file frequently: before and after any major action (like debugging sessions), and at the end of each work session. Include timestamps and detailed summaries of actions taken.
- When starting a debugging session (e.g., debugging X), record a "Debug Session Start" entry with the current context, including breadcrumbs that reference the related branch or project segment.
- During the session, continuously log what you're doing along with any insights, using clear breadcrumbs to indicate where you branched off from the main project context.
- Upon completion of debugging, summarize the findings and immediately update the relevant long-term project documents (e.g., roadmap.md, project documentation for X) with the finalized insights.
- Clearly mark transitions: when a temporary working note becomes a permanent part of the project record, copy the essential details into the long-term documents, and then archive or annotate them in this file.
- Optionally, include a template or checklist within this document as a guide for each debugging or experimental session to ensure consistency.
