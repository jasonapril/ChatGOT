# Project Status and Refactoring Plan 2025-03-26

## Current State Assessment

### Training Performance
- Model has reached a plateau with:
  - Loss around 0.45-0.52
  - Character prediction accuracy ~86%
  - Top-5 character prediction accuracy ~95%
  - Processing speed ~7000 tokens/s
  - GPU memory usage stable at ~1GB (only 25% of available 4GB)
  - Low GPU utilization indicating potential for optimization

### Code Structure Issues
1. **Training Script Complexity**
   - `train_with_samples.py` has grown too large (1000+ lines)
   - Multiple responsibilities mixed together
   - Complex nested functions making code hard to follow
   - Duplicate code in sampling and validation functions

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Config loading and validation scattered across files
   - No clear separation between model, training, and data configs
   - Hard-coded values mixed with configurable parameters

3. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Multiple logging mechanisms (file, console, tensorboard)
   - Inconsistent log formatting
   - No structured metrics collection
   - TensorBoard integration needs improvement

4. **Checkpoint Management**
   - Basic checkpoint saving/loading
   - No versioning or metadata tracking
   - No automatic cleanup strategy
   - No validation of checkpoint integrity

## Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Code Organization
1. **Split Training Script**
   - Create separate modules for:
     - Training loop
     - Validation
     - Sampling
     - Checkpoint management
     - Metrics tracking

2. **Configuration System**
   - Implement structured config classes
   - Separate model, training, and data configs
   - Add validation and defaults
   - Create config documentation

3. **Logging System**
   - Create unified logging interface
   - Implement structured metrics
   - Improve TensorBoard integration
   - Add log rotation and cleanup

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
1. **Memory Management**
   - Review and optimize memory usage
   - Implement better garbage collection
   - Add memory profiling tools
   - Optimize data loading
   - Increase GPU utilization (currently only using 25% of available 4GB)
   - Implement dynamic batch sizing based on available GPU memory
   - Add GPU memory usage monitoring and optimization

2. **Training Pipeline**
   - Optimize data preprocessing
   - Improve batch processing
   - Add pipeline profiling
   - Implement better error handling

### Phase 3: Monitoring and Debugging
1. **Metrics System**
   - Implement comprehensive metrics collection
   - Add performance profiling
   - Create visualization tools
   - Add debugging utilities

2. **Checkpoint System**
   - Implement versioned checkpoints
   - Add metadata tracking
   - Create checkpoint validation
   - Implement automatic cleanup

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Core Components**
   - Begin with configuration system
   - Then split training script
   - Finally implement new features

2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**
   - Keep existing config format working
   - Add new features gradually
   - Provide migration guides

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Add unit tests for new components
   - Create integration tests
   - Implement performance benchmarks
   - Add validation tests

## Timeline Estimate

1. **Phase 1: 1-2 weeks**
   - Code organization
   - Configuration system
   - Basic logging improvements

2. **Phase 2: 1-2 weeks**
   - Performance optimization
   - Pipeline improvements
   - Memory management

3. **Phase 3: 1 week**
   - Monitoring system
   - Checkpoint improvements
   - Documentation updates

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve refactoring plan
2. Set up project tracking
3. Create development branches
4. Begin with configuration system
5. Implement changes incrementally
6. Maintain regular testing and validation
