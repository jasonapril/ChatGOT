# ChatGoT Model Debugging Progress

## Current Status
- ✅ Checkpoint saving/loading functionality works
- ✅ Basic training process working with 14M parameter model
- ✅ Implemented safe gradient checkpointing
- ✅ Implemented safe mixed precision training
- ✅ Improved logging system with dual output
- ⬜ Need to restore remaining stripped features

## Completed Fixes
- ✅ Fixed indentation error in training loop at line 464
- ✅ Implemented proper checkpoint saving every 100 steps
- ✅ Reduced checkpoint interval to 2 minutes
- ✅ Improved checkpoint loading process to handle gradient checkpointing
- ✅ Created clean configuration file (14M param version)
- ✅ Re-enabled gradient checkpointing with safe error handling
- ✅ Added automatic cleanup of old checkpoints
- ✅ Implemented safe mixed precision with NaN detection and fallback
- ✅ Created improved logging system with separate console and file output

## Features To Restore
- ✅ Gradient checkpointing (for memory efficiency)
- ✅ Mixed precision training
- ⬜ Batch size adjustments based on OOM errors
- ⬜ More advanced sampling during training
- ⬜ Loss trend tracking and LR adjustments

## Configuration Versions
- `chatgot_test.yaml` - Original 85M parameter model
- `chatgot_small_25M.yaml` - Smaller 25M parameter model
- `chatgot_small_25M_memory.yaml` - Memory-optimized version
- `chatgot_small_14M_clean.yaml` - Clean debugging version (14M)
- `chatgot_small_14M_gradient_checkpoint.yaml` - Test config for gradient checkpointing
- `chatgot_small_14M_mixed_precision.yaml` - Test config for mixed precision

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Restore gradient checkpointing with proper handling
2. ✅ Re-enable mixed precision training
3. ⬜ Test dynamic batch size adjustment
4. ⬜ Implement comprehensive error handling 
5. ⬜ Review and optimize training loop

## Known Issues
- ⬜ ETA calculation can be unstable during early training
- ⬜ Need more robust OOM error handling
