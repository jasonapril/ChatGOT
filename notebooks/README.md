# Notebooks (`notebooks/`)

## Purpose

This directory holds Jupyter notebooks used for interactive exploration, data analysis, visualization, rapid prototyping, and debugging.

## Structure

Organize notebooks logically, for example:
-   `notebooks/`
    -   `eda/`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
    -   `prototyping/`: Quick model or feature tests.
    -   `evaluation/`: Analyzing results from experiments.
    -   `tutorials/`: Step-by-step guides or examples.

## Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive filenames for notebooks (e.g., `01_data_loading_check.ipynb`).
- Keep notebooks focused on a specific task or analysis.
- Add markdown cells to explain the steps and conclusions.
- Refactor useful, stable code from notebooks into reusable functions or classes in `src/` or `scripts/`.
