Memory Management Module
=======================

This module provides advanced memory management strategies for maximizing GPU utilization
during training. It focuses on:

1. Aggressive VRAM pre-allocation to maximize throughput
2. Dynamic memory monitoring and optimization during training
3. Device-specific optimizations for different GPU models
4. Emergency memory management for OOM prevention

The module prioritizes MAXIMUM performance by fully utilizing available GPU VRAM.
It employs aggressive strategies that push utilization to 98-99% of available memory,
contrary to more conservative approaches that typically target 70-80% utilization.

Design Principles:
- Maximum VRAM utilization = Maximum throughput
- Pre-allocate memory to force high utilization
- Optimize allocation patterns for specific GPU architectures
- Maintain high utilization throughout training
- Implement safeguards against OOM errors
