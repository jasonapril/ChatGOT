# Training Module

This directory contains the training framework, designed to provide a modular and efficient system for model training, evaluation, and text generation.

## Structure

The training module is organized into the following components:

* `trainer.py`: Main coordinator class that integrates all training components
* `training_loop.py`: Core training loop logic with optimizations for efficiency
* `evaluation.py`: Model evaluation functionality
* `checkpointing.py`: Checkpoint management and state persistence
* `callbacks.py`: Flexible callback system for extending training behavior
* `generation.py`: Text generation capabilities with various sampling strategies
* `progress.py`: Progress tracking and logging utilities
* `optimizations.py`: Training optimizations like mixed precision and gradient accumulation
* `utils.py`: Common utility functions
* `amp.py`: Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) support

## Features

* **Modular Design**: Each component has a single responsibility and clear interfaces
* **Flexible Training**: Support for various training configurations and optimizations
* **Robust Checkpointing**: Save and resume training state with comprehensive error handling
* **Extensible Callbacks**: Easy to add custom behaviors during training
* **Multiple Generation Methods**: Support for different text generation strategies
* **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging and metrics with fallback options
* **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for handling large models and datasets

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from training.trainer import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    val_dataloader=val_dataloader,
    optimizer=optimizer,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    config=config,
    checkpoint_dir="checkpoints",
    use_amp=True
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()

# Generate text
generated_text = trainer.generate_text(
    prompt="Once upon a time",
    max_new_tokens=100,
    temperature=0.8
)
```

See individual module docstrings for detailed API documentation.

## Core Principles

* **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one aspect of training
* **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
* **Type Safety**: Type hints throughout for better IDE support
* **Memory Optimization**: Efficient handling of large models/datasets
* **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and customize behavior

## Development Guidelines

When modifying or extending this module:

1. Follow the single responsibility principle
2. Add appropriate type hints
3. Include comprehensive error handling
4. Add docstrings and comments for complex logic
5. Write unit tests for new functionality
6. Update this README when adding new features
