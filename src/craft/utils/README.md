# Utilities (`src/craft/utils/`)

This package provides common utility functions used throughout the Craft framework.

Examples include:

- `logging.py`: Configuration and helpers for logging.
- `io.py`: Utilities for file input/output operations.
- `common.py`: General-purpose helper functions (e.g., setting random seeds).
- `generation.py`: Low-level generation utilities (e.g., sampling functions like `top_k_top_p_filtering`).

These utilities aim to be generic and reusable across different modules.
