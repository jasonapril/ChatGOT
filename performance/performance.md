# ChatGoT Performance Project

This document outlines the performance improvement project for ChatGoT, focused on maximizing efficiency, reducing memory usage, and increasing throughput.

## Relationship to Optimizations

This project builds upon and extends the work documented in [optimizations.md](optimizations.md), with a greater focus on architectural and fundamental improvements rather than just training optimizations.

## Project Goals

1. **Reduce parameter count** without sacrificing model quality
2. **Increase throughput** (tokens/second) during training and inference
3. **Decrease memory usage** to enable larger batch sizes or larger models
4. **Improve scaling** for both larger datasets and models

## Architecture Optimizations

| ID | Optimization | Status | Impact | Difficulty | Description |
|----|--------------|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| A01 | Decoder-Only Architecture | Planned | High | Medium | Remove unused cross-attention mechanism to save ~28M parameters |
| A02 | Optimized Attention Implementation | Planned | High | Medium | Replace standard attention with optimized version |
| A03 | Custom LayerNorm | Planned | Low | Low | Replace standard LayerNorm with optimized version |
| A04 | Parameter Sharing | Planned | Medium | Medium | Explore parameter sharing between certain layers |
| A05 | Architectural Width/Depth Rebalancing | Planned | Medium | Low | Experiment with different width/depth trade-offs for same parameter count |

## Implementation Optimizations  

| ID | Optimization | Status | Impact | Difficulty | Description |
|----|--------------|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| I01 | Fused Kernel Operations | Planned | Medium | High | Implement custom CUDA kernels for core operations |
| I02 | Memory Pooling | Planned | Medium | Medium | Implement memory pooling to reduce allocation overhead |
| I03 | Custom Backward Passes | Planned | Medium | High | Optimize backward pass implementations |
| I04 | Loop Unrolling | Planned | Low | Medium | Unroll critical loops for performance |
| I05 | Cache Optimization | Planned | Medium | Medium | Optimize cache usage patterns |

## Training Optimizations

See [optimizations.md](optimizations.md) for training-specific optimizations like gradient accumulation, mixed precision, etc.

## Prioritized Implementation Plan

1. **A01: Decoder-Only Architecture** - Immediate focus
   - Remove unused cross-attention mechanism
   - Reduce parameter count by ~28M
   - Expected memory savings: ~25%
   - Expected speedup: ~5-10%

2. **A02: Optimized Attention Implementation**
   - Replace with FlashAttention or similar optimized attention
   - Expected speedup: ~20-40%

3. **I01: Fused Kernel Operations**
   - Create fused operations for key performance hotspots
   - Expected speedup: ~10-30%

## Measurement and Benchmarking

All optimizations will be measured using:
- Tokens per second (training throughput)
- Memory usage (GPU VRAM)
- Training time per epoch
- Inference latency
- Model quality metrics

Results will be documented in a standardized format with benchmarks on various hardware.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing these optimizations, we will:
1. Create modular implementations that can be enabled/disabled
2. Document performance impact on different hardware
3. Ensure backward compatibility where possible
4. Add appropriate unit tests and benchmarks
