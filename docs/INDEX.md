# Documentation Index

This file serves as a central hub for all documentation in the AI model development environment.

## Documentation Structure

Our documentation is organized into the following categories:

- **Guides** - Instructions and tutorials for using the system
- **Logs** - Debugging and progress tracking
- **Development** - Development process and workflow (in [flow/](../flow/) directory)

## Documentation Standards

To maintain consistency across all documentation:

### File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with underscores for directory names (e.g., `project_docs/`)
- Use lowercase with underscores for filenames (e.g., `debugging_guide.md`)
- Follow consistent naming patterns within categories

### Documentation Structure
1. Start with a clear title and brief introduction
2. Include a table of contents for longer documents
3. Use consistent heading levels (# for title, ## for sections, etc.)
4. Include code examples when relevant
5. End with next steps or related documents

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review and update all documentation for consistency
- [x] Complete the reorganization of development documentation
- [x] Update cross-references between documents
